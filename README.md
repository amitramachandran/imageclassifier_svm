# imageclassifier_svm

This is a image classifier trained on SVM that displayes the image with the prediction output. 
The classifier is trained on seperating pugs and eskimo dogs. 

Change the images in the folders and folder names to customize to your needs. 

Make sure to install Tkinter since the matplotlib needs it to display the images in pycharm.
